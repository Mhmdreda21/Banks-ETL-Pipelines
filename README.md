# Banks-ETL-Pipelines
This project extracts data about the worldâ€™s largest banks from Wikipedia, transforms it by converting market capitalization into multiple currencies (USD, GBP, EUR, INR), and logs each process step. The pipeline is built using Python (pandas, numpy) and demonstrates a simple ETL workflow.
